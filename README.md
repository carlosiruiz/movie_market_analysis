## Introduction

The goal of this project is to assist Microsoft Corp in its entrance into the international movie industry. With this goal in mind, our team set out to collect data related to the most popular movies released between the years 2000 and 2019. Utilizing The Movie Database's API we were able to retrieve information for over 9,000 movies, including relevant features such as release_date, genre, budget, revenue, and more. Following an extensive cleaning process, we utilized this dataset to answer the following questions:

```
1. Who are the top production companies
-- by movie count
-- by mean movie revenue
2. Which genres have the greatest revenue potential
3. What is the best month to release a movie, by genre
4. What is the distribution of runtime per the 5 best genres
```

In answering the above questions, we utilized the following libraries:

```
### Data Collection
pandas
requests
json

### Data Visualization
pandas
matplotplib.pyplot
seaborn
```
